## Introduction
This is a script to create a repositery, name it, put a description, init the folder locally, add a new branch (main), push it to Git Hub and makes it private through the command line automatically. <br/>
It makes me save a lot of times and could make you save times too! <br/>

## Installation
First of all, clone the repositery by doing <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/Soofiaaa/repositery-creator.git` <br/>
After go in the directory of the script and run the following command. <br/>
`chmod +x create_repo.sh` <br/>
After that, you will need to change certain value in the create_repo.sh. <br/>
Open create_repo.sh and you will see that I commented certains lines. <br/>
Modify those <br/>

```bash
USERNAME="" # Put your username inside the ""
PASSWORD="" # Put your password inside the ""
TOKEN="" # Put your token inside the "" 
```
To run the script do <br/>
`./the_directory/create_repo.sh`
