## Introduction
This script is made to name, put a description, init the folder, make a new branch (main) and push everything on Git Hub through the command line automatically. <br/>
It makes me save a lot of times and could make you save times too! <br/>

## Installation
First of all, clone the repositery by doing <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/Soofiaaa/repositery-creator.git` <br/>
After go in the directory of the script and run the following command.
`chmod +x create_repo.sh` <br/>
To run the script do <br/>
`./the_directory/create_repo`
